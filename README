work-assumptions: 

- There is no problem to reprice the product to the same price.

- Only this service writes and reads these files.
(if there are more instances, instead of counting the records as a global variable we will count the amount of records in the file.
It will be needed to lock the file.)

- The program is stable and won't fall.
(if so, a new id for file will be craeted.)

- A request is sent every second.
